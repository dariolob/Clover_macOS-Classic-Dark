<p align="center">The non selected entries will turn to life with colors when selected.
Smaller monitors will also have a Classic Mac OS styled scrollbar when needed.</p>

Notes:
I couldn't really get the scrollbar to work exactly as intended for now, seems to be a really buggy feature.
I might take requests for icons etc. if there's interest, we'll see.
Designed with 2.5K monitors in mind, let me know if something doesn't look right at other resolutions.






<p align="center">Enjoy!</p>
